The swipe up for the extra options is good.

Yeap just had a quick look. Looks good so far. Personally think the continuous scroll is my fav. Just feel like its easier


Menu 1.0



Menu 2.0
This formate but with the icons?

Menu 3.0

Menu is the best because of impaired vision 
Merge options 1 and 3, based on font size but having the icon makes it more accessable. Icons in circle looks like seperate button
Circle looks separate button join images with buttons




HiFi Feedback:

Settings and Motions alarm Buttons too close together

Cant easily see the Zoom and Cam01 etc onthe screen so might require a background

Menu is too bright and blue - Spread the menu apart - made the background dim more when modal is open.
